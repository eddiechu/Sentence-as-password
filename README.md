# Sentence as Password

The space is a legal character in most password forms. This means you can use a normal sentence as password. e.g. 

``I like the food in Hong Kong, my password is super super strong ;8)``

(consists 67 characters with number, capital letters, symbols)

It’s much easier to remember than ``8ft@!*TeeSea`` and it’s also more secure when used in the proper manner.

Just having a sentence as your password can create a nightmare for hackers, according to a number of security experts, one of them being Thomas Baekdal. 
The advantage of using a sentence is that it’s much easier to remember than ``8ft@!*TeeSea`` and it’s also more secure when used in the proper manner.
