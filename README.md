# Sentence as Password

The space is a legal character in most password forms. This means you can use a normal sentence as password. e.g. ``There is no double about it, Hong Kong is foodie heaven, dim sum, egg tart, etc 8)``

It’s much easier to remember than ``8ft@!*TeeSe`` and it’s also more secure when used in the proper manner.

Just having a sentence as your password can create a nightmare for hackers, according to a number of security experts, one of them being Thomas Baekdal. 
The advantage of using a sentence is that it’s much easier to remember than 8fa@!*FaicC and it’s also more secure when used in the proper manner.
